<p style="margin-bottom: 20px">Greetings from PSAU!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 20px">This message is to inform you of the results of your Admissions Test. </p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 20px"><strong>Your test score is the transmuted score using the STANINE method.
        Stanine (STAndard NINE) is a method of scaling test scores on a nine-point standard scale with 9 being
        the highest and 1 being the lowest.</strong>
    <br>
    This is one of the two things that the admitting personnel of your choice programs will look into when
    you are evaluated, the other being your report card/TOR.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 20px">Your STANINE is <strong>{{ Stanine }}</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 20px">The admitting personnel of your first-choice program has started the evaluation.
    <strong>EVALUATION</strong> means that they will look at your
    <strong>STANINE</strong> and <strong>TOR/COG </strong>grades and evaluate whether you are qualified or not
    based on the approved policies of the program. If upon evaluation, you are not deemed qualified, the admitting
    personnel of your second-choice program shall evaluate you.
    <br>
    Results of the evaluation shall be emailed to you within
    <strong> 15 working days. We ask for your patience and understanding as you WAIT for your next email. </strong>
