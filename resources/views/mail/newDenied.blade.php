    <p>Dear {{ $applicant_name ?? '[Applicant\'s Full Name]' }},</p>

    <p>
        We appreciate your interest in Pampanga State Agricultural University. We appreciate the time and effort you
        invested in completing the application process.
    </p>

    <p>
        After careful review and thorough evaluation of all submitted documents and qualifications, we regret to inform
        you that
        <strong>you have not been admitted</strong> from your chosen programs.
        This decision was based on an assessment of all applicants, and due to the highly competitive nature of the
        selection process, not all qualified candidates could be accommodated.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please be assured that this outcome does not reflect your lack of potential but rather the limited number of
        slots available this term.
        We encourage you to consider applying again in the future, should you wish to pursue the program at a later
        date.
    </p>

    <p>
        We wish you all the best in your future academic and professional endeavors.
    </p>
